Welcome to SOILE - Your behavioral lab on the Internet
======================================================

SOILE software is a web-based programmable behavioral testing and training platform that handles 
experiment creation, administration, and data collection. The experiment code is translated to a 
set of JavaScript instructions that can be run locally on the users’ web browser. Tasks can either 
be coded by SOILE’s simple programming language or by the free PsychoPy® desktop application. You
can also utilize SOILE’s or Psychopy’s task library. The experiment builder in SOILE allows you
to organize your tasks into a wide variety of experimental setups, from simple linear designs 
to complex multi-group settings.
