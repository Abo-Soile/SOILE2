Task Properties
===============

As with all other objects in SOILE a task is versioned as mentioned in the :doc:`concept section </users/concepts>`.
In addition, tasks, as the actual processing units are responsible to generate the data collected by the system.
As such they can generate the following types of data:
1. Result Data
2. File Data
3. Output Data
4. Persistent Data

Result Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Result data is the most common type of data generated by a task. It is data in a JSON like format, 
i.e. matching keys to values. This data is for external data evaluation, and can contain e.g. 
answers to a questionnaire or results from a reaction test, among others.  

File Data
~~~~~~~~~

This is essentially the same as Result Data, but refers to data that is too large to store in a field of a database.
Examples can be e.g. video or audio recordings that tend to become quite large. This data is handled 
differently by the system. Currently only Javascript tasks support this type of data processing.

Output Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

Output data is a special category of result data. Output data has to be numeric and can be used as filters
to guide the study flow for a participant. You could e.g. decide, that a given questionnaire is only presented 
to participant who answered in a specific way to some question. This answer would then be marked as output data
on the quastionnaire language task and can be used in the next experiment to not present a certain step.

Persistent Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Similar to Result data Persistent Data is a special category of Result data, that is available in other tasks.
Persistent data can be generated from any variable created in a Questionnaire Language task. The Experiment 
Language also allows definition of persistent variables (TODO: Add details here). And in javascript you can add
persistent data within the task. However, due to the way javascript generates variables, there is no automatic way to 
extract the possible available persistent variables, and they are hard coded in js.
